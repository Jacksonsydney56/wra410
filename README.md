# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.
I changed the background to a darker purple and then the div containers into a lighter purple

2. Use a new font.
I used 'Courier New', monospace; because it think the extra space makes it easier to read 

3. Include two images.
I added images below every assignment, this way it is consistent and makes that page more interesting

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.
I thought the information was clear so I didn't change mush besides adding a table that creates space between the different points

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  
I used a table, consistent background color and link color to what I had been using
It's also reformatted to fit the screen better

6. Add navgation to the Schedule webpage.
I made this consistent with the other pages, I also added "groups" to all of the nav bars because it wasn't on every page

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.
I didn't mind how the columns were set up but I wanted homework to visible and I broke up the dates too so that it was easier to read
